=head1 NAME

App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Retry - implement retry pragma/command line option

=head1 VERSION

This document describes App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Retry version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    simple_scan --retry 6

    or in a simple_scan input file:
    %%retry 6

Both of these would retry fetches up to 6 times, pausing an increasingly-long
time between each try.  If all attempts fail, the failure reported with the last fetch
is reflected back to the test program; if at any point the fetch
succeeds, further retry attempts are abandoned.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Retry> allows C<simple_scan> to use the
C<retry> function implemented by the C<WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable>
retry plugin.

This allows you to retry a transaction multiple times; it checks
C<$mech->success> to see if the transaction was successful. 

If you need more sophisticated retry testing, you're better off scripting
this yourself using C<WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable> and 
C<WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Retry>. One way is to use the C<%%retry> pragma in input to 
C<simple_scan --gen> to generate skeleton code, and then replace
the call to C<retry> to C<retry_if> with the appropriate 
status check subroutine (see C<WWW::Mechanize::Pluggable::Retry>
for more details).

=head1 INTERFACE 

=head2 options

Options supported by this plugin: C<--retry>, with one argument, the retry count.

=head2 pragmas

Pragmas supported by this plugin: C<%%retry>, same arguments as --retry.

=head2 retry

Setter/getter for the current retry count. Used by both the pragma and
the command-line option to store the argument value.

=head2 retry_pragma
Implements the actual code: stacks a call to C<mech->retry> on the
outgoing code stream, or a call to C<fail> if the argument is not 
a number.

=head2 validate_options

Generates a virtual C<%%retry> pragma for the value given on the command line.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --retry

Allows you to specify a global retry count for the input file to be
processed. If the input file contains C<%%retry> pragmas, the count
will be reset as these pragmas are encountered.

=head1 PRAGMAS

=head2 %%retry

Set the retry count immediately to the new count specified as the
argument.

    %%retry 3
    http://unsteady.org/ /.../ Y Look for expected text
    %%retry 0
    http://steady.org/   /.../ Y Same text

A retry count of zero means that the fetch will not be retried.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 C<< "retry count '$args' is not a number >>

Issued by the generated test code if Perl can't parse the retry
count (either from a pragma or the command line) as a valid number.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

App::SimpleScan::Plugin::Retry requires no configuration files or environment variables.
